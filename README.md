The Odin Project Assignment

Hi,

I hope to demonstrate my skills using just HTML and my ability to do do the following:
    1. Set up the basic structure of HTML
    2. Use different level headings in a page
        - To show the hierarchy of the information presented.
    3. Link to other pages
    4. Present pictures/images in your site
    5. Use ordered and unordered list
    6. Use various HTML entities when appropriate

These are various things that I have learned throughout my HTML lesson and I hope to be able to showcase my abilities here.

Thank You,
N Adh
