        <h2 div class="h2">Directions</h2>
            <p class="step">Step 1&colon;</p>
                <p class="disc disc">Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</p>
            <p class="step">Step 2&colon;</p>
                <p class="disc disc">Coat the inside of a 10-inch, 10 - 12 cup
                capacity tube pan or Bundt pan with butter and flour or floured
                baking spray.</p>
            <p class="step">Step 3&colon;</p>
                <p class="disc disc">In a large mixing bowl, add the butter,
                sugar, salt, and lemon extract. Beat until the mixture is light
                and fluffy. Add the eggs to the mixture one at a time, and beat
                each egg completely into the mixture before adding the next.</p>
            <p class="step">Step 4&colon;</p>
                <p class="disc disc">Add the baking powder and a little flour to
                the wet mixture, and beat just until combined. Then, alternate
                additions of milk and flour, mixing well in between additions until
                it&rsaquo;s all incorporated and batter is smooth. Finally, stir* in
                half of the grated lemon zest (save the other half of the zest for
                the glaze).</p>
            <p class="step">Step 5&colon;</p>
                <p class="disc disc">Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake 40 minutes
                and check to determine how much more baking time is needed to avoid
                over-baking. Bake 45 to 55 minutes - just until a toothpick or skewer
                inserted into the thickest part of the cake comes out clean.</p>
            <p class="step">Step 6&colon;</p>
                <p class="disc disc">While cake is baking, prepare the glaze: Pour
                lemon juice and granulated sugar into a small bowl and stir well until
                sugar crystals dissolve. Stir the other half of the lemon zest.</p>
            <p class="step">Step 7&colon;</p>
                <p class="disc disc">When cake has finished baking, remove from oven
                and allow to cool in the pan for about ten (10) minutes.</p>
            <p class="step">Step 8&colon;</p>
                <p class="disc disc">If needed, gently shake the pan or use a butter knife
                to loosen the cake from the sides of the pan. Remove cake from the pan by
                placing a serving plate over the top of the pan and gently inverting the pan
                so they cake rests on the serving plate.</p>
            <p class="step">Step 9&colon;</p>
                <p class="disc disc">While cake is still warm, slowly spoon or brush a layer
                of the glaze all over the cake. Allow the first layer of glaze to sink in,
                then repeat with the rest of the glaze.</p>
            <p class="step">Step 10&colon;</p>
                <p class="disc disc">Garnish the warm, freshly-glazed cake with more lemon
                zest and allow the cake to cool completely before cutting.</p>
            <p class="step">Step 11&colon;</p>
                <p class="disc disc">If making ahead: Cover cake completely and store at
                room temperature overnight or up to two days. Refrigerate if keeping longer.</p>
